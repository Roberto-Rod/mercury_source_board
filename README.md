The project is compiled (synthesized & implemented) using Xilinx ISE WebPack v14.7 on Windows 7/10 x64. There should not be a problem compiling on another OS supported by the Xilinx tools e.g. Linux.

Simulations were performed in ActiveHDL Plus Edition v10.3.

Most of the testbenches are not "self-checking" due to initial engineering time constraints. Each simulation needs to be manually inspected in the waveform window. However, new testbenches are self-checking and make use of the Bitvis utility library.
