--  CHANNEL_INIT_SM
--
--
--
--  Description: the CHANNEL_INIT_SM module is a state machine for managing channel
--               bonding and verification.
--
--               The channel init state machine is reset until the lane up signals
--               of all the lanes that constitute the channel are asserted.  It then
--               requests channel bonding until the lanes have been bonded and
--               checks to make sure the bonding was successful.  Channel bonding is
--               skipped if there is only one lane in the channel.  If bonding is
--               unsuccessful, the lanes are reset.
--
--               After the bonding phase is complete, the state machine sends
--               verification sequences through the channel until it is clear that
--               the channel is ready to be used.  If verification is successful,
--               the CHANNEL_UP signal is asserted.  If it is unsuccessful, the
--               lanes are reset.
--
--               After CHANNEL_UP goes high, the state machine is quiescent, and will
--               reset only if one of the lanes goes down, a hard error is detected, or
--               a general reset is requested.
--
--               This module supports 1 4-byte lane designs
